# Google OAuth Setup Guide

## The Problem
You're getting a "Missing required parameter: client_id" error because the Google OAuth configuration is missing the required environment variables.

## Solution

### 1. Environment File Created ✅
The `.env.local` file has been created with your comprehensive configuration. You just need to add your Google OAuth credentials:

```bash
# Add these values to your existing .env.local file:
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_google_client_secret
```

### 2. Get Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
5. Set the application type to "Web application"
6. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback` (for development)
   - `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/google/callback` (for production)
7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env.local` file

### 3. Update Your Environment Variables

Replace the empty values in your `.env.local` file:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""` → Your actual Google Client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""` → Your actual Google Client Secret
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret-here"` → Generate a random secret (optional but recommended)

### 4. Restart Your Development Server

After creating the `.env.local` file, restart your Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test the OAuth Flow

1. Navigate to your login page
2. Click the "Sign in with Google" button
3. You should be redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen
4. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to your app

## Current Configuration Status

✅ Auth configuration file syntax fixed
✅ OAuth URLs properly configured
✅ Callback route properly set up
✅ Environment file created with comprehensive configuration
✅ .gitignore file removed as requested
❌ Google OAuth credentials need to be added to .env.local

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:
1. Verify your Google OAuth credentials are correct
2. Check that the redirect URI in Google Console matches your app's callback URL
3. Ensure your `.env.local` file is in the project root
4. Restart your development server after making changes
